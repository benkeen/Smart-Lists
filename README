Smart Lists is light-weight (8KB) script that lets you convert "flat" HTML lists of information into categorized, paginated lists. In essence, it's a presentation layer for improving the readability of related information, without requiring a database or server-side script. I wrote it way back in 2008, but the code is fairly decent and may come in handy for someone.

You can read the documentation and see an example of the script on my site:

The script is available as both jQuery or Prototype plugins.
